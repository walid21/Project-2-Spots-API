What is BeSpot?
It’s a place where you can share your favorites BeSpot. Or if you miss some ideas , you could search for some Spots already shared by our BeSpotter. 
It could also be anything because it’s more than an API , it’s a way of life. That's why anyone can have his own definition. 
So come and share yours on BeSpot!
